# **Precautionary Measures**

1. Ensure that your CPU is compatible with your systems' motherboard socket.
: AMD processors will commonly have pins on the chip, while Intel processors have their pins in the motherboard socket.
2. Ensure that your system is powered off and your power cord is disconnected from the power supply.
3. Ground yourself and use anti-static protection to avoid damaging your components.
